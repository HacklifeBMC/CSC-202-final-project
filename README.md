#Part A
  * Write a program to read two 3x3 matrices, and compute the sum
  *   and the product of the two matrices. Then, compute the transpose matrix,
  *   cofactor matrix, and the determinant of the resultant matrix. Then find
  *   the inverse of the first matrix then multiply it by the first column of
  *   the second matrix to get a third matrix. Test the program using matrices
  *   given in class.
  *   
  *   In this program write a different method to perform the operations and
  *   use proper notation to pass the arguments and to access the elements.
  *   
  *   Use files for input and output. Make sure to use a class and objects.
  *   Use a constructor and (an) overloaded constructor(s) to initialize the
  *   object.


#Part B

 * Write a program to simulate the operation of a simple robot. The robot
  *   moves in four directions: forward, backward, right, and left. It's job
  *   is to pick up items and place them in the right slots in each station.
  *   There are 10 stations (8 normal, 1 pickup, 1 unload). Robot will start
  *   at the pickup station. Only 8 items can be placed on each station. The
  *   nearest station must be filled before robot can start placing items on
  *   the next stations. The items shall be marked with id (serial) numbers.
  *   The items with even serial numbers go to the right, and items with odd
  *   serial numbers go to the left. The last odd slot, 7, is to be reserved
  *   for light items which are less than 80 kg. The serial number is a five
  *   digit number, the MSD (most significant digit left most base 10 digit)
  *   5 indicates that the product must be placed in the fifth station which
  *   should keep the product at 20 degrees Fahrenheit. When it receives the
  *   message of unload, the machine should start emptying the fifth station
  *   and placing the items in the refrigeration container (station 9) until
  *   it is empty
