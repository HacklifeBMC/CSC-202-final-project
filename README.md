  * Write a program to read two 3x3 matrices, and compute the sum
  *   and the product of the two matrices. Then, compute the transpose matrix,
  *   cofactor matrix, and the determinant of the resultant matrix. Then find
  *   the inverse of the first matrix then multiply it by the first column of
  *   the second matrix to get a third matrix. Test the program using matrices
  *   given in class.
  *   
  *   In this program write a different method to perform the operations and
  *   use proper notation to pass the arguments and to access the elements.
  *   
  *   Use files for input and output. Make sure to use a class and objects.
  *   Use a constructor and (an) overloaded constructor(s) to initialize the
  *   object.
